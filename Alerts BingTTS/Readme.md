# Alarm widget for bing TTS 

This widget is designed to allow the siren to use Azure TTS service.
It also has audio-only functionality, without any visual display.


### How to use

1. First you need to sign up for [Azure Text to Speech][L1] service.
2. You need to fill in the API Key, API Region and [Voice name][L2] into the TTS settings.
3. When everything is set correctly, the widget will load with the test sound "TTS is Load".

The SSML function has not been added yet, so it does not support pitch and speed adjustment.

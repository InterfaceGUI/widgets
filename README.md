The storage for community created custom widgets for StreamElements.com!

## How to Use

Every widget should be stored in its own folder, inside of which should contain a widget.html, a widget.js, widget.css and a widget.json file.

This repository is available for any StreamElements user to create new widgets, copy existing widgets, or edit existing widgets through Pull Requests, which will be accepted/rejected/commented by contributors.
